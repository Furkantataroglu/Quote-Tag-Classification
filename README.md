# Quote-Tag-Classification
# Explanation

## In this project, the dataset was created by scraping quotes, their authors, and their tags from the website quotes.toscrape.com. The target labels are the tags associated with each quote. The goal of the model is to predict the top 3 most relevant tags for a given quote. Accordingly, the accuracy metric was designed to measure how well the model predicts these top 3 tags. The overall aim is to build an automatic tag generation system based on the content of the quote.
